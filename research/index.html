<h3>Music and language</h3>
<p>As a lifelong musician, the intersection of music and language has been at the heart of my linguistic interests 
  from the start. I’m interested in the potential of music for language revitalization efforts, but also in the 
  integration of musical and linguistic data in linguistic analysis — what can we learn by treating the combination 
  of music and language as a holistic site of inquiry rather than than simply language data with a melody?</p>
<p>To that end, I’m currently focused on describing new methodologies that combine (ethno)musicological and linguistic approaches, 
  and applying them to questions of both structural (i.e. tone systems, phonetic variation, morphology) and sociocultural 
  (i.e. code-switching, identity) linguistics.</p>
<p>A few of the projects I’ve worked on with regards to music and language are:</p>
<li><b>Tone and tune in Tlahuapa Tu’un Sàví</b> <br>(presentation given at WAIL 20, 2017; slides, handout)
 <p style="margin-left: 40px">On integrating musical information into linguistic data in Élan, Praat, etc., and the relationship between musical melody and lexical tone in this Mixtec language.
</p></li>
<li><b>Code-Switching and Chord Changes: Building Identity through Musicolinguistic Signs in Welsh Rock Music</b> 
  <br>(presentation given at AAA 2016; 
  <a href = /Sleeper_AAA_2016_paper.pdf>paper</a>, 
   <a href = /Sleeper_AAA_2016_slides.pdf>slides</a>, 
   <a href = /Sleeper_AAA_2016_handout.pdf>handout</a>)

<h3>Patagonian Welsh</h3>

<h3>More</h3>
<p>Besides these main foci, my research interests also language contact, code-switching, phonetics, and VOT more broadly, as well as phonation,
  Cherokee, Bergamasque, Ainu, anime, and manga in translation.</p>
